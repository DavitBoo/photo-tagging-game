# Photo Taggin Game
**Pokemon based Photo Taggin Game:** just try to find the 3 starter Pokemons from the 1st Gen.
Once you find them you will be able to save your score (the seconds you took to catch all) with your name, and save it in the ranking.
Can you find them faster than the 1st one? üòè

## Intro

The aim of the project is to practice with Firebase backend and also to keep using React.

## Overall
<ul>
<li>Mostly what I was looking for, it was to practice reading and writing in <strong>Firebase</strong> and to get a little loose when configuring it.</li>
<li>It has also helped me to interact a little bit with the mouse and the dimensions of the screen.</li>
<li>And on the other hand I have taken the opportunity to use <strong>Styled-Components</strong>.</li>
<li>It has also helped me to become more familiar with the use of useEffect.</li>
<li>useCallback: like <i>handleStartTimer</i> there are some other passed to other components as a prop, without useCallback, everytime App.js is rendering a new instance of the handleStartTimer function will be created, which may cause the child component to be re-rendered unnecessarily. To avoid this behavior, we use useCallback</li>
</ul>

## Styled-Components
<p>I was inspired to use CSS global variables in Styled-Components in this article</p>
